ACHIEVEMENTS AT THIS POINT

1. At this point, I can create products and add them to the store.
2. I can also create posts and like the post
3. I can edit the user profile
4. I can change the user's profile and cover pictures

TODOS
1. I want to add the ability to follow people... so, you'd be able to view posts from those people that you've followed. 
IMPLEMENTATION:
From my backend, I have to create another manager for the sponsored posts and also for following people.

2. I want to be able to advertise a product ie. making a post about the product and making it show as a ad(probably with a sponsored tag with it)... So, every user would be able to see a sponsored post.

3. And finally add the ability to buy a product, either from the sponsored post or from the user's store.

4. A link to the store of a particular user would also be in the user's profile/timeline.
