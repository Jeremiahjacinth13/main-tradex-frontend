Come on... can't you see, the country is hurting, People are dying... the revolution is beginning, the revolution has begun... We cried for a change, we pleaded for a change... Now we'll die for a change... and If the changes don't come.... WE WON'T STOP FIGHTING... WE'LL PUT UP A FORCE STRONGER THAN YOUR ARMY... There's something you don't know.... That no government is and will ever be stronger than the people.... Our words and cries will always prevail... and there is no going back until that happens.... #ENDSARS #ENDCORRUPTGOVERNMENT #ENDEVILGOVERNMENT
